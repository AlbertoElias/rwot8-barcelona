# The Current Status of the DID Specification

By Amy Guy and Dmitri Zagidulin, Digital Bazaar

Work on the [Decentralized Identifier 1.0 specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) began at RWOT \#2 in May 2016, and a draft was published on 21 November 2016. Work continues under the custody of the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/), a group of 237 members, who contribute by taking part in [weekly teleconference calls](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/), engaging in discussions on the [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/), and [raising issues on the spec on GitHub](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec/issues/). This document serves as a summary of the current state of work, including a rough categorization of the current open issues. If you're new to DIDs, or want a refresher on the background and core concepts of the DID spec, you will find it useful to read the [DID Primer](did-primer.md) (or [extended DID Primer](did-primer-extended.md)) first.
